# everyday

A way of tracking something you do every day

# Philosophy

The philosophy behind the "everyday" project is threefold;

1. Doing something small (or big) that you enjoy every day is good for your well-being. We need to take time for ourselves.
1. Repeating something every day is habit-forming, and positive habits are good for us.
1. Projects can be overwhelming, and that makes it hard to start and even harder to _restart_ if you stop. Doing something on a project every day keeps you moving forwards.

**everyday** is a web app that keeps track of something that you do every day, and encourages you to keep going, especially if you miss a day. It was inspired by the Github contributions graph, which I use to track my "coding every day" habit, and I wanted to expand for other people to track their projects too.
